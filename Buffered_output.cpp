//You have been given the Writer class, which can write data on the screen, in a file or in memory - in general, it doesn't matter where. This class has a virtual function Write, which accepts a pointer to the input bytes of memory and their number. The function tries to write these bytes to the right place. 

//Class from "writer.h"
