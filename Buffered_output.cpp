//You have been given the Writer class, which can write data on the screen, 
//in a file or in memory, in general, it doesn't matter where. 
//This class has a virtual function Write, which accepts a pointer to the input bytes of memory and their number. 
//The function tries to write these bytes to the right place. 

//However, the output operation has overhead, and frequent Write calls with small data sizes can slow down the program.
//You need to write inherited class BufferedWriter that would perform buffered output. 
//The constructor of this class must take a parameter of type size_t - the size of the buffer.
//Overriden Write function must first write to the internal buffer, 
//and only when it is full, call Write of the base class with the data of this buffer. At the end of the usage of the class, 
//the remaining data in the buffer must also be written through the call to the base class's Write function.

//Class from "writer.h"
//—Ålass Writer {
//public: 
//funtction for output (not given by task)
//    virtual void Write(const char * data, size_t len) {}
//};
