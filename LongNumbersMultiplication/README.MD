# Homework 1
Calculator.cpp contains code that allows to sum, multiply and substract long numbers. Also contains Karatsuba algorithm, it multiplies long numbers faster, has complexity O(n^1,6).

Remark: this is a rather old task, when I was a beginner in C++. That's why this code definetely needs to be refactored, there shoud be better names for variables.
